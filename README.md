# Carpet Sky Additionals
## Additional Additions to Carpet Sky Additions!
## This mod is in ALPHA, expect breaking changes often!

Playing with more friends is fun, but with that comes the need for some extra room. This mod allows you to create completely independent "worlds" to play in.
These worlds are (supposed to be) exactly like vanilla, so expect all of your machines and contraptions to work! 

### How to use:
```yaml
Commands:
- /islands (Opens up a GUI in which you can customize your Islands)
- /islands-admin (Opens up the admin control panel which can delete Islands, and add and remove players)

More documentation to come!
```

### Because this mod is preproduction, expect bugs to occur. Please report the bugs on our Github Issue Tracker or on our discord!
